                    <p>Platelet Rich Plasma, therapy is a treatment designed to 
                        <br>aid in the healing and regeneration of soft tissues such as 
                        <br>tendons, ligaments and muscles. PRP is the injection of 
                        <br>the patients own platelets, in high concentration into an 
                        <br>injured tendon, ligament or muscle tear. The platelets 
                        <br>contain growth factors which help stimulate natural healing.</p>

                    <p>CytoRich-PRP is a new therapeutic product and is similar 
                        <br>to PRP, but with an enriched anti-inflammatory/catabolic 
                        <br>component. CytoRich-PRP comprises an abundant 
                        <br>concentration of anti-inflammatory and regenerative 
                        <br>agents that are intended to treat damaged and/or injured 
                        <br>connective tissue, and chronic conditions such as 
                        <br>tendonitis, muscle tears, and degenerative joint 
                        <br>conditions such as osteoarthritis.</p>
                    <p>Unlike PRP, CytoRich-PRP has two components: a 
                        <br>regenerative and an anti-inflammatory component. The 
                        <br>regenerative component is similar to PRP, while the anti-
                        <br>inflammatory component is enriched with anti-inflammatory, anti-
                        <br>catabolic and regenerative proteins 
                        <br>that increase CytoRich-PRP therapeutic potential 
                        <br>comparing to PRP treatment.</p>
                    <p>CytoRich is an efficient and safe product for Osterarthritis 
                        <br>treatment since it has been reported as a source of 
                        <br>human bioactive molecules playing a key role in the 
                        <br>fundamental processes of stimulating tissue reapir and 
                        <br>regenerations. Health Canada Approval has been received 
                        <br>for Indications for the treatment of Osteoarthritic Knee 
                        <br>and Osteopathic Hip.</p>

                    <p>Shockwave is an acoustic wave which carries high energy 
                    <br>to painful spots of myoskeletal tissues with subacute, 
                    <br>sub-chronic and chronic conditions. The energy promotes

                    <br>tendons, and other soft tissues. Shockwaves are 
                    <br>characterized by jump change in pressure, high amplitude 
                    <br>and non-periodicity. The kinetic energy of the projectile, 
                    <br>created by compressed air, is transferred to the 
                    <br>transmitter at the end of the applicator and further into 
                    <br>the tissue.</p>

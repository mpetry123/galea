                <h2 class="heading">PLATELET RICH PLASMA (PRP) THERAPY</h2>
                <p>Platelet Rich Plasma, therapy is a treatment designed to 
                    <br>aid in the healing and regeneration of soft tissues such as 
                    <br>tendons, ligaments and muscles. PRP is the injection of 
                    <br>the patients own platelets, in high concentration into an 
                    <br>injured tendon, ligament or muscle tear. The platelets 
                    <br>contain growth factors which help stimulate natural healing.</p>

                <h2 class="heading">CYTORICH – PRP</h2>
                <p>CytoRich-PRP is a new therapeutic product and is similar 
                    <br>to PRP, but with an enriched anti-inflammatory/catabolic 
                    <br>component. CytoRich-PRP comprises an abundant 
                    <br>concentration of anti-inflammatory and regenerative 
                    <br>agents that are intended to treat damaged and/or injured 
                    <br>connective tissue, and chronic conditions such as 
                    <br>tendonitis, muscle tears, and degenerative joint 
                    <br>conditions such as osteoarthritis.</p>
                <p>Unlike PRP, CytoRich-PRP has two components: a 
                    <br>regenerative and an anti-inflammatory component. The 
                    <br>regenerative component is similar to PRP, while the anti-
                    <br>inflammatory component is enriched with anti-inflammatory, anti-
                    <br>catabolic and regenerative proteins 
                    <br>that increase CytoRich-PRP therapeutic potential 
                    <br>comparing to PRP treatment.</p>
                <p>CytoRich is an efficient and safe product for Osterarthritis 
                    <br>treatment since it has been reported as a source of 
                    <br>human bioactive molecules playing a key role in the 
                    <br>fundamental processes of stimulating tissue reapir and 
                    <br>regenerations. Health Canada Approval has been received 
                    <br>for Indications for the treatment of Osteoarthritic Knee 
                    <br>and Osteopathic Hip.</p>

                <p>Shockwave is an acoustic wave which carries high energy 
                    to painful spots of myoskeletal tissues with subacute, 
                    sub-chronic and chronic conditions. The energy promotes 
                    regeneration and reparative processes of the bones, 
                    tendons, and other soft tissues. Shockwaves are 
                    characterized by jump change in pressure, high amplitude 
                    and non-periodicity. The kinetic energy of the projectile, 
                    created by compressed air, is transferred to the 
                    transmitter at the end of the applicator and further into 
                    the tissue.</p>

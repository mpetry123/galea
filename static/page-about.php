                <p>The Institute of Human Mechanics was founded by Dr.
                    <br> Anthony Galea, a visionary physician who believes 
                    <br>in administering the best solutions possible for his patients, 
                    <br>no matter what stands in his way.</p>
                <p>With ground- breaking innovation including using Platelet 
                    <br>Rich Plasma Therapy (PRP) to treat injury as well as his 
                    <br>patented Cytorich formula, Dr. Galea has transformed the 
                    <br>lives of his patients for the better, including Alexander 
                    <br>Rodriguez, Tiger Woods and as a physician for Team 
                    <br>Canada in the 1998 Winter Olympics. A visionary with sight 
                    <br>set on a new world of healthcare, Dr. Galea is recruiting 
                    <br>the best healthcare practitioners from across the world 
                    <br>who are making his vision a reality.</p>

                <h2 class="heading">PLATELET RICH PLASMA (PRP) THERAPY</h2>
                <p>Platelet Rich Plasma, therapy is a treatment
                    <br> designed to aid in the healing and regeneration of 
                    <br>soft tissues such as tendons, ligaments and <
                        br>muscles. PRP is the injection of the patients own 
                        <br>platelets, in high concentration into an injured 
                        <br>tendon, ligament or muscle tear. The platelets 
                        <br>contain growth factors which help stimulate natural 
                        <br>healing.</p>

                <h2 class="heading">CYTORICH - PRP</h2>
                <p>CytoRich-PRP is a new therapeutic product and is 
                    <br>similar to PRP, but with an enriched anti-
                    <br>inflammatory/catabolic component. CytoRich-PRP 
                    <br>comprises an abundant concentration of anti-
                    <br>inflammatory and regenerative agents that are 
                    <br>intended to treat damaged and/or injured 
                    <br>connective tissue, and chronic conditions such as 
                    <br>tendonitis, muscle tears, and degenerative joint 
                    <br>conditions such as osteoarthritis. </p>
                <p>Unlike PRP, CytoRich-PRP has two components: a 
                    <br>regenerative and an anti-inflammatory component. 
                    <br>The regenerative component is similar to PRP, 
                    <br>while the anti-inflammatory component is enriched 
                    <br>with anti-inflammatory, anti-catabolic and 
                    <br>regenerative proteins that increase CytoRich-PRP 
                    <br>therapeutic potential comparing to PRP treatment.</p>
                <p>CytoRich is an efficient and safe product for 
                    <br>Osterarthritis treatment since it has been reported 
                    <br>as a source of human bioactive molecules playing a 
                    <br>key role in the fundamental processes of 
                    <br>stimulating tissue reapir and regenerations. Health 
                    <br>Canada Approval has been received for Indications 
                    <br>for the treatment of Osteoarthritic Knee and 
                    <br>Osteopathic Hip.</p>
